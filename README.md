Flight Delay and Cancellation Causes Analysis
This repo is used to analyze the data to identify patterns in flight delays and cancellations
and to determine the factors that contribute to these delays (e.g., weather, mechanical issues, air
traffic, etc.). using the dataset from https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml for the years 2004 to 2008.
